# Independent-Study-Code
There is a jupyter notebook with my independent study code which includes a SGD binary and multiclass classification ML model, along with a script 
that allows the user to draw a number freely and let the model predict what class it is. First run the algorithms.py file, then you can run the drawing_canvas.py to draw a number freely, then select the model and it will show the predicted number.
